# AutoHotKey
My personal autohotkey scripts

My naming scheme for the scripts is fairly simple:
The first part is the key used, then a dash, then the program it opens or function it does.  
I use one dash to indicate if the script opens a program.
Two dashes are used to indicate some sort of keyboard shortcut.

Sidenote: I put ^Esc::ExitApp at the end of all my scripts in case you want to stop it from running, just press Ctrl+Esc and that will close it down.
