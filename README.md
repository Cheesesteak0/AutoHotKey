# AutoHotKey
My personal autohotkey scripts (and a few I grabbed and changed up for personal use)

The naming scheme is as follows:

The name of the script briefly tells what it does.
Looking inside the file I left notes on exactly what each one does and the keyboard shortcuts to activate them.

Also I use this at the end of all of my scripts: ^Esc::ExitApp.
What this does is it allows me to force shut down any currently running .ahk file by press Ctrl+Esc.

This purpose of this is mainly just incase one of the scripts malfunctions this will shut it and the rest running down.
