# AutoHotKey
My personal autohotkey scripts (and a few I grabbed and changed up for personal use)

### The naming scheme is as follows:

The name of the script briefly tells what it does.
Looking inside the file I left notes on exactly what each one does and the keyboard shortcuts to activate them.

### Standard script endings
End script: ^Esc::ExitApp.
Suspend script: ^Pause::Suspend

This allows me to force shut down any currently running .ahk file by pressing Ctrl+Esc or suspend with Ctrl+Pause.

This purpose of this is mainly just in case one of the scripts malfunctions this will shut it and the rest running down.

I am working on writing a script that will allow me to open all my scripts with one button and then shut them all down by pressing control and the button.
